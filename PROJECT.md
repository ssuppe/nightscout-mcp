# **Project: Nightscout MCP Server**

## **1. Project Overview**

This project aims to create a read-only MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Nightscout, a popular open-source diabetes management platform. The server will enable AI agents to access a user's Nightscout data, allowing for advanced analysis, insights, and visualizations.

The server will be written in TypeScript and will initially support v1 of the Nightscout API. The architecture will be designed to be extensible, allowing for the future implementation of v2 and v3 of the API.

## **2. Project Plan**

The following is the high-level plan for this project:

1.  **PRD - Product Requirements**
    *   Define CUJs (Customer User Journeys)
    *   Define MCP Server Tools
2.  **Design - System Architecture**
    *   High-Level Architecture Diagram
    *   Data Models (TypeScript Interfaces)
    *   API Client Design
3.  **Implementation**
    *   Project Setup
    *   Implement API Client (v1)
    *   Implement `get_treatments` tool
    *   Implement `get_average_glucose` tool
    *   Implement `get_entries` tool
    *   Implement `get_profile` tool

## **3. Progress to Date**

We have successfully completed the initial planning and design phases of the project.

*   **Product Requirements Document (`PRD.md`):** We have created a detailed PRD that outlines the customer user journeys, the initial set of MCP server tools, and the configuration strategy.
*   **Design Document (`DESIGN.md`):** We have created a design document that includes a high-level architecture diagram and the TypeScript data models for the `Treatment`, `Entry`, and `Profile` API endpoints.

## **4. Next Steps**

The next step is to move into the implementation phase. This will involve:

1.  **Setting up the project:** Initializing a new TypeScript project, installing dependencies, and setting up the basic server structure.
2.  **Implementing the API client:** Creating a client to interact with the Nightscout v1 API.
3.  **Implementing the MCP server tools:** Creating the tools defined in the PRD.
